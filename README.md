# Multilingual-Complex-Named-Entity-Recognition-via-Data-Augmentation

As part of The 16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2022) [Task 11: MultiCoNER
Multilingual Complex Named Entity Recognition](https://multiconer.github.io/), this repository contains a template inspired by [Simple Data Augmentation for Named Entity Recognition](https://aclanthology.org/2020.coling-main.343.pdf).

The [template notebook](https://github.com/oyousuf/Multilingual-Complex-Named-Entity-Recognition-via-Data-Augmentation/blob/main/template.ipynb) comments through the code for each of the 4 basic data augmentation methods and also 2 more optional methods.

Formatting of the named entity recognition (NER) files is .conll. Entities considered for this task were PROD (Person), GRP (Group), CORP (Corporation), CW (Creative Work), PER (Person), LOC (Location), O (other, none, N/A). Other entities in an NER.conll file could be applied, but you would have to alter the template code as you see fit. The beginning of each named entity begins with an identifier (# id ...).
